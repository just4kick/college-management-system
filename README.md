# College Management System

NOTE: This forked repository contains the implementation of Docker containers and Docker Compose.

Curious about Docker containers and Docker Compose? 

### Docker container
Think of Docker containers as magic boxes that package everything your application needs to runâ€”code, libraries, and dependenciesâ€”into a neat, portable bundle. Theyâ€™re lightweight, fast, and ensure your app works seamlessly across different environments, from your laptop to a production server.

### Docker Compose
Now, imagine you have multiple containers (like a frontend, backend, and database) that need to work together. Thatâ€™s where Docker Compose comes in! With a simple docker-compose.yml file, you can define, configure, and orchestrate all these containers effortlessly. One command, and voilÃ â€”your entire application ecosystem springs to life!

To start the project, just run:

```
sudo docker compose up -d
```
And to stop it, use:

```
sudo docker compose down
```

How cool is that? With just one command, you can start and stop the entire stackâ€”frontend, backend, and face-recognition servicesâ€”all in a snap! It's that easy and efficient!

* The .env file in this repository does not contain any sensitive information for me, but it's not recommended to push it to the repository.

## Prerequisites

### For Windows
1. **Python**: Install Python 3.7 or above from [Python Official Site](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
   - During installation, make sure to check the option **Add Python to PATH**.
   - To verify installation, open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and run:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
     If Python is installed correctly, it will display the version.

2. **Visual Studio**:  
   - Install [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-studio/).
   - During installation, **select the Desktop development with C++ workload**.
   - This step is required for building dependencies like `dlib`.

3. **CMake**:  
   - Download [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).
   - During installation, choose the option **Add CMake to PATH**.
   - To confirm installation, run:
     ```bash
     cmake --version
     ```
     If installed correctly, it will display the version.

### For Linux
1. Install Python and development tools using the following commands:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y python3 python3-venv python3-pip
   ```

2. Install required build tools:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libx11-dev libgtk-3-dev
   ```
   - **If you encounter errors while installing `dlib`**, ensure that these tools are installed correctly.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
- Use Git to clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone <repository_url>
  cd <repository_name>
  ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
- Run `npm i` in both the 

frontend

 and 

backend

 folders:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm i
  cd ../backend
  npm i
  ```

### Step 3: Create Necessary Folders
- Create a `public` folder in the 

backend

 folder, and then create a `temp` folder inside the `public` folder:
  ```bash
  mkdir -p backend/public/temp
  ```

### Step 4: Create .env Files
- Create a `.env` file in both the 

frontend

 and 

backend

 folders and copy the contents of `frontENV.txt` to the frontend `.env` and the contents of `backENV.txt` to the backend `.env`.

### Step 5: Run the Servers

#### Python Server
1. Navigate to the `python-model` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend/src/python-model
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/Scripts/activate
   ```
3. Run the face verification script:
   ```bash
   python face_verification.py
   ```

#### Backend Server
1. Navigate to the 

backend

 directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Frontend Server
1. Navigate to the 

frontend

 directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Docker Installation

If you prefer to use Docker for setting up the face recognition model, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t face_recognition_model -f backend/src/Dockerfile .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 face_recognition_model
   ```

This will set up the face recognition model without worrying about dependencies.

```

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "isMatch": true,

```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Error: Python not recognized**:
   - Ensure Python is installed and added to the system PATH.
   - Restart the terminal after installation.

2. **Error: Failed to build `dlib`**:
   - On Windows:
     - Verify that Visual Studio with the Desktop Development with C++ workload is installed.
   - On Linux:
     - Run the command to install build tools:
       ```bash
       sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libx11-dev libgtk-3-dev
       ```

3. **Error: Flask App Not Starting**:
